THINGS TO FIX:
1. Input for parameter cannot be a char or string, has to be a number
	--> Could do this by using the ASCII Characters
	--> int(input)

2. Fix the problem with LRL and why when no input is give it changes to the next parameter value
	--> Have no idea why this is happening

3. Ability to make new user when the database if empty ***
	--> Currently the code requires there to be at least one user in the database


THINGS TO INCLUDE:
1. Have ERROR message displayed when you try to create a new user when the database is full

2. Have ERROR message displayed when you try to login with user/pass that does not match in the
database

3. When new user is created have a note that says creation successful!
