THINGS TO FIX:

(seems to be Done) 1. Input for parameter cannot be a char or string, has to be a number
	--> Could do this by using the ASCII Characters
	--> int(input)

(Done) 2. Fix the problem with LRL and why when no input is give it changes to the next parameter value
	--> Have no idea why this is happening

(Done) 3. Ability to make new user when the database if empty ***
	--> Currently the code requires there to be at least one user in the database

(Done) 4. infinite loop when registering new user with invalid inputs






THINGS TO INCLUDE:

(Done) 1. Have ERROR message displayed when you try to create a new user when the database is full -> in WelcomeScreen 

(Done) 2. Have ERROR message displayed when you try to login with user/pass that does not match in the -> in WelcomeScreen 
database

(Done) 3. Have ERROR message when false register username/password entry -> in NewUser 

(Done) 4. Store parameter values as floats

5. Have SUCCESS message when register works 
	--> message will be in WelcomeScreen AFTER transitioning to it from the register function in NewUser
	--> could not get this to work, but this is also not necessary

6. "The user interface shall be capable of visually indicating when the DCM
and the device are communicating." 
	--> requirement 4 in 3.2.2 DCM User Interface in PACEMAKER.pdf

7."The user interface shall be capable of visually indicating when a different
PACEMAKER device is approached than was previously interrogated." 
	--> requirement 7 in 3.2.2 DCM User Interface in PACEMAKER.pdf
